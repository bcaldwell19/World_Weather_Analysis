>PLANMYTRIP is a top travel technology company that specializes in internet-related services in the hotel and lodging industry. Jack is the head of analysis for the user interface team. He's asked you to help him collect and present data for customers via the search page, which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel, anywhere in the world.
As part of your analysis, you will need to perform statistical calculations on the data using linear regression on the weather parameters in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. This data will help your team predict the best time of year for people to plan their vacation. Finally, you will export the data, clean it, and use the weather data to choose the best cities for vacation based on certain weather criteria, and then map these cities using GeoViews and the Geoapify API. Are you ready to help travelers find their ideal vacation spot? If so, pack your suitcase and let's get started.
